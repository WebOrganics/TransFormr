TransFormr is a simple toolkit that uses PHP and XSLT for extracting and transforming microformats <http://microformats.org/>.

Microformats that are supported by this transformer are:

	* hCard <http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard>.
	* hCalendar <http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar>.
	* hReview <http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview>.
	* hAtom <http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom>.
	* geo <http://microformats.org/wiki/geo>.
	
Microformats that are supported by this transformr but are classed as *Experimental* and should not be used in a production environment because they may be removed or updated at any time are:

	* hAudio <http://microformats.org/wiki/haudio>.
	* hMedia <http://microformats.org/wiki/hmedia>.
	* XFN <http://gmpg.org/xfn/>
	* rel-enclosure <http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-enclosure>
	
Non microformats supported by this transformer are:
	
	* RDFa <http://rdfa.info/>
	
== Installation ==

You must have PHP version 5.2.0 or higher with XSLT enabled to run TransFormr.

	* Download the latest version of Transformr from http://github.com/WebOrganics/TransFormr.
	* Unpack the entire contents of the file called WebOrganics-TransFormr-XXXXX to your webserver either into its own directory or the the root of your directory (dedicated transformers only). 
	* Surf your way to wherever you unpacked your file eg: http://example.com/transformr/ it works ( and looks ) exactly the same as the webservice available at http://transformr.co.uk/.
	* Enter a url, Have fun transforming some microformats ;)
	
== Conversions ==

Main conversions are:
	* Detect => Detect all.
	* hCard => vCard (.vcf) and vCard RDF.
	* hCalendar => iCal (.ics) and vCal RDF.
	* hAtom => Atom.
	* hReview => RDF.
	* Geo => KML

Experimental conversions are:

	* hAudio => RSS2.
	* hAtom + rel-enclosure => RSS2.
	* hAtom + hMedia => MRSS.
	* hCard + XFN => FOAF (hFoaf).
